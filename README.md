# 🗺️ The Complete DBMS Learning Roadmap

This repository follows a **structured DBMS learning roadmap**, guiding from **basic database concepts** to **advanced real-world database implementation**.

The roadmap is divided into **three phases**:
- Beginner (Foundations & SQL)
- Intermediate (Design & Integrity)
- Advanced (Performance, Security & Projects)

---

## 📘 Phase 1: Foundations & SQL Mastery (Beginner)

This phase focuses on **core database theory** and **SQL fundamentals** for relational databases.

| Step | Topic | Key Concepts | Practice / Tools |
|----|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Core Concepts | What is DB/DBMS, RDBMS vs NoSQL, Database Architecture (3-Tier) | TutorialsPoint, Neso Academy |
| 2 | Relational Model | Tables, Attributes, Tuples, Keys | Primary Key, Foreign Key, Integrity Constraints |
| 3 | Basic SQL (DDL) | CREATE, ALTER, DROP | Practice on MySQL / PostgreSQL |
| 4 | Data Manipulation (DML) | SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | W3Schools, Codecademy, SQLZoo |
| 5 | Advanced SQL | WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, JOIN, Subqueries | HackerRank SQL Challenges |

---

## 📗 Phase 2: Design & Integrity (Intermediate)

This phase focuses on **efficient database design**, **data integrity**, and **optimization**.

| Step | Topic | Key Concepts | Practice / Tools |
|----|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Data Modeling | ER Diagrams, Relationships (1:1, 1:M, M:N) | Draw ER diagrams for mini projects |
| 2 | Normalization | 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF | Normalize sample schemas |
| 3 | Transaction Management | ACID Properties | Study transaction reliability |
| 4 | Views & Indexing | Views, Clustered & Non-Clustered Indexes | Create indexes & analyze performance |

---

## 📙 Phase 3: Advanced Concepts & Real-World Application (Advanced)

This phase focuses on **performance**, **security**, **NoSQL**, and **complete backend projects**.

| Step | Topic | Key Concepts | Practice / Tools |
|----|------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Concurrency Control | Locks, Deadlocks, Isolation Levels | Study Two-Phase Locking (2PL) |
| 2 | Query Optimization | Execution Plans, EXPLAIN | Analyze slow queries |
| 3 | Database Systems | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server | Install DB & practice backup/restore |
| 4 | NoSQL Databases | MongoDB, Cassandra, Graph DBs | Complete a NoSQL tutorial |
| 5 | Final Project | Complete Backend System | E-commerce / Social Media DB with API |

---

## 🎯 Final Project Goal

Build a **complete backend system** that includes:
- Database schema design
- DDL & DML implementation
- Indexing & optimization
- Integration with a backend framework  
  (Python + Flask / FastAPI or Node.js + Express)
